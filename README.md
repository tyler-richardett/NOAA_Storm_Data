# Overview

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. The data analysis addresses the following questions: 
1. Across the United States, which types of events are most harmful with respect to population health? 
2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
